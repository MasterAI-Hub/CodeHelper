## 📦 Setup

### 🛡️ macOS Gatekeeper – How to Run the App

If you see a warning like:  
**“CodeHelper” cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.**

Here’s how to manually allow it:

1. **Try to open the app** (you’ll get a warning).
2. Go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security**.
3. Scroll down to the **Security** section.
4. You’ll see a message:  
   **“CodeHelper was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer.”**
5. Click **“Open Anyway”**.
6. Try launching the app again — click **“Open”** when prompted.

> 🔁 You only need to do this once. After approval, the app will launch normally.

3. Grant screen recording permission:
